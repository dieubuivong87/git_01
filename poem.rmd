In the cradle of dawn, a miracle unfolds,

Tiny fingers, a story yet to be told.

A baby's breath, a gentle sigh,

Innocence wrapped in a lullaby.




Eyes like stars, sparkling and bright,

A universe within, a captivating sight.

Soft coos and giggles, pure delight,

A canvas of joy, a palette so light.




Tiny toes that curl and wiggle,

A heartbeat, a rhythm, a dance so little.

In the arms of love, a cozy nest,

A treasure chest of moments, the very best.



With each babble, a language anew,

A symphony of laughter, a melody true.

Dreams woven in a crib of bliss,

A tiny hand to gently kiss.




Oh, sweet miracle, so small yet grand,

A masterpiece crafted by nature's hand.

In the cradle of love, you snugly lay,

A precious dawn of a brand-new day
